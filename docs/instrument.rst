The COM interface
=================

The methods and classes directly represent the COM objects exposed by the *Scripting* interface.
The interface is described in detail in the scripting manual of your microscope
(usually in the file ``scripting.pdf`` located in the ``C:\Titan\Tem_help\manual`` or
``C:\Tecnai\tem_help\manual`` directories).

The manual is your ultimate reference, this documentation will only describe the
python wrapper to the COM interface.

The COM apartment model will automatically be initialized as ``COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED``
(this changed in Version 2.1.0, it was ``COINIT_MULTITHREADED`` before). However, if the
apartment model was already initialized as ``COINIT_MULTITHREADED`` before `temscript`
was imported, `temscript` will also work. If you want a specific apartment model, set the
variable ``sys.coinit_flags`` before importing `temscript`.


Enumerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many of the attributes return values from enumerations. These enumerations can be found in the
:mod:`temscript.enums` module.

.. versionchanged:: 2.0
    All methods of the COM interface now directly return the enumeration objects. The constants
    from temscript version 1.x are not defined anymore. The numerical values still can be accessed
    by querying the corresponding enum, e.g. ``psmSA`` corresponds to ``ProjectionSubMode.SA``.

Vectors
^^^^^^^

Some object attributes handle with two dimensional vectors (e.g. ``ImageShift``). These
attributes return ``(x, y)`` like tuples and expect iterable objects (``tuple``,
``list``, ...) with two floats when written (numpy arrays with two entries also work).

Interface classes

            Returns *StageStatus* instance instead of integer.

    .. attribute:: Position

        (read) Current position of stage. The function returns a ``dict``
        object with the values of the individual axes ('x', 'y', 'z', 'a', and 'b').

    .. attribute:: Holder

        (read) *StageHolderType* Type of holder

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0
            Returns *StageHolderType* instance instead of integer.

    .. method:: AxisData(axis)

        Returns tuple with information about that axis. Returned tuple
        is of the form (*min*, *max*, *unit*), where *min* is the minimum
        value, *max* the maximum value of the particular axis, and *unit* is
        a string containing the unit the axis is measured in (either 'meters' or
        'radians'). The *axis* must be one of the axes ('x', 'y', 'z', 'a', or 'b').

    .. method:: GoTo(x=None, y=None, z=None, a=None, b=None, speed=None)

        Moves stage to indicated position. Stage is only moved along
        the axes that are not ``None``.

        Optionally the keyword *speed* can be given, which allows to set the
        speed of the movement. 1.0 correspond to the default speed.

        .. note::
            At least with Titan 1.1 software, moving the stage along multiple axes with *speed* keyword set
            fails. Thus movement with *speed* set, must be done along a single axis only. See :ref:`restrictions`.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0.10
            "speed" keyword added.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0
            Internally the ``GoToWithSpeed`` method is used, when the *speed* keyword is given. Previous to version 2.0,
            the ``GoToWithSpeed`` method was only used if the *speed* keyword was different from 1.0.

    .. method:: MoveTo(x=None, y=None, z=None, a=None, b=None)

        Moves stage to indicated position. Stage is only moved along
        the axes that are not ``None``. In order to avoid pole-piece
        touch, the movement is carried out in the following order:

            b->0; a->0; z->Z; (x,y)->(X,Y); a->A; b->B

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0
            Invalid keywords raise ValueError (instead of TypeError)

Fluscreen and plate camera
--------------------------

.. class:: Camera

    Fluorescent screen and plate camera related methods.

    Since the plate camera is not supported anymore on newer Titans most of the methods
    of the Camera class are meaningless. Nevertheless, the attributes :attr:`ScreenCurrent`
    :attr:`MainScreen`, and :attr:`IsSmallScreenDown` still are usefull for fluscreen control.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    .. attribute:: Stock

        (read) *int* Number of plates still on stock

    .. attribute:: MainScreen

        (read/write) *ScreenPosition* Position of the fluscreen.

    .. attribute:: IsSmallScreenDown

        (read) *bool* Whether the focus screen is down.

    .. attribute:: MeasuredExposureTime

        (read) *float* Measured exposure time (seconds)

    .. attribute:: FilmText

        (read/write) *str* Text on plate. Up to 96 characters long.

    .. attribute:: ManualExposureTime

        (read/write) *float* Exposure time for manual exposures (seconds)

    .. attribute:: PlateuMarker

        (read/write) *bool*

        .. note:: Undocumented property

    .. attribute:: ExposureNumber

        (read/write) *int* Exposure number. The number is given as a 5 digit number
        plus 100000 * the ASCII code of one of the characters '0' to '9' or 'A' to 'Z'.

    .. attribute:: Usercode

        (read/write) *str* Three letter user code displayed on plate.

    .. attribute:: ManualExposure

        (read/write) *bool* Whether the `ManualExposureTime` will be used for plate exposure.

    .. attribute:: PlateLabelDataType

        (read/write) *PlateLabelDateFormat* Format of the date displayed on plate

    .. attribute:: ScreenDim

        (read/write) *bool* Whether the computer monitor is dimmed

    .. attribute:: ScreenDimText

        (read/write) *str* Test displayed when the computer monitor is dimmed.

    .. attribute:: ScreenCurrent

        (read) *float* The current measured on the flu screen (Amperes)

    .. method:: TakeExposure()

        Take single plate exposure.


Miscellaneous classes
---------------------

.. class:: InstrumentModeControl

    .. attribute:: StemAvailabe

        (read) *bool* Quite self decribing attribute

    .. attribute:: InstrumentMode

        (read/write) *InstrumentMode* TEM or STEM mode

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0
            Returns *InstrumentMode* instance instead of integer.


.. class:: BlankerShutter

    .. attribute:: ShutterOverrideOn

        (read/write) *bool* Overrides shutter control.

        .. warning::

            From the manual: If this override is on, there is no way to
            determine externally, that the override shutter is the active.
            So **always** reset this value from script, when finished.


.. class:: Configuration

    .. attribute:: ProductFamily

        (read) *ProductFamily* Microscope type

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0
            Returns *ProductFamily* instance instead of integer.
